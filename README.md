## About

Mewn is perhaps the easiest way to embed assets in a Go program. Here is an example:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/leaanthony/mewn"
)

func main() {
	myTest := mewn.String("./assets/hello.txt")
	fmt.Println(myTest)
}
```

If compiled with `go build`, this example will read `hello.txt` from disk.
If compiled with `mewn build`, it will embed the assets into the resultant binary.

## Installation

`go get github.com/leaanthony/mewn/cmd/mewn`

## Usage

Import mewn at the top of your file `github.com/leaanthony/mewn` then use the simple API to load assets:

- `String(filename) (string)` - loads the file and returns it as a string
- `Bytes(filename) ([]byte)` - loads the file and returns it as a byte slice
- `MustString(filename) (string)` - loads the file and returns it as a string. Any error is considered fatal
- `MustBytes(filename) ([]byte)` - loads the file and returns it as a byte slice. Any error is considered fatal

### Groups

To bundle a whole directory, simply declare a group like this:

`myGroup := mewn.Group("./path/to/dir")`

From this point you can use the same methods above, but on the group:

`myAsset := myGroup.String("file.txt")`

Groups also have the following method:

  - `Entries() []string` - Returns a slice of filenames in the Group


## Mewn cli command

The `mewn` command does 3 things:

- If you run `mewn`, it will recursively look for mewn.\* calls in your .go files. It will then generate intermeriary go files with assets embedded. It does not compile them into a final binary.
- `mewn build` will do the above, but compile all the source, then delete the intermediary files. This makes things a bit cleaner.
- `mewn pack` will do the same as `wails build`, but will compile with the go flags `-ldflags "-w -s"` to compress the final binary even more.

For the `build` and `pack` subcommands, any other cli parameters will be passed on to `go build`.

## Caveats

This project was built for simple embedding of assets and as such, there are a number of things to consider when choosing whether or not to use it.

- Mewn just deals with bytes. It's up to you to convert that to something you need. One exception: String. Just because it's super likely you'll need it.
- When using the top-level methods, EG: mewn.String(), it uses a default group called ".". Creating your own group called "." shouldn't do anything, but I'm not going to guarrantee it. You've been warned ðŸ˜‰
- Paths to assets need to be unique (within a Group). If you try to pack 2 files with the same relative path with the same group (or default group), it isn't going to work. 
- Once this project reaches 1.0, it is _extremely_ unlikely that any new features will be added in the future. This is by choice, not necessity. I want this project to be extremely stable so if you choose to use it today, it should work exactly the same in 3 years time. If it doesn't currently do what you want, you are probably looking for a different project. However, if you have a phenomenally good idea, feel free to open an issue.
- The project works by parsing the AST tree of your code. It works when you use the form `mydata := mewn.String('./myfile.txt')` to import your data (IE string literal, not variable). It may not (yet) work for similar code. Very happy to receive bug fixes if it doesn't.

Bug reports are _very_ welcome! Almost as much as PRs to fix them!

## What does 'Mewn' mean?

Mewn (MEH-OON as fast as you can say it, not meee-oon) is the [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language) word for "in".

## Why go for a crazy Welsh name?

Well, it stands out as a project name (practically zero name clashes) and is one of the oldest and coolest languages in Europe (which I'm lucky enough to speak). JRR Tolkien was [obsessed with Welsh](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z2hthyc). So much so, he based the Middle Earth Elvish language "Sindarin" on it and there's strong evidence he based LOTR on Welsh mythology. It's also associated with [Red Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Wales), weirdly loved by the Bundesliga football team [FC Schalke](https://twitter.com/s04_us) and it's on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/course/cy/en/Learn-Welsh), so why not give it a go ðŸ˜‰.

## Inspiration

Heavy inspiration was drawn from [packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) by the awesome Mark Bates. The scope of what I needed was far narrower than the packr project, thus Mewn was born. If Mewn doesn't fulfil your needs, it's likely that packr will.
